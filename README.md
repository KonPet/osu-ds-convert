# osu-ds-convert

Convert osu beatmaps (with the latest [.osu file format](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/osu%21_File_Formats/Osu_%28file_format%29)) to the format [osu ds](https://github.com/echojc/osu-ds) wants

It doesn't yet convert anything. Currently it is hardcoded to convert [*Miracle Sugite Yabai (feat. shully)*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/682290/#osu/1442771). 
**NOTE**: Is currently meant to be for the original fork of [osu-ds](https://github.com/echojc/osu-ds).

The next things to do are timing points, break points and hit points.
